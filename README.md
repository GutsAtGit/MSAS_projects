# MSAS_projects

Course project for Modeling and Simulation of Aerospace Systems in the MSc Aeronautical Engineering program at Politecnico di Milano.
This repository demonstrates proficiency in system modeling, dynamic simulation, and control analysis using MATLAB, Simulink, and OpenModelica.
### File-1:
Six ODE-based aerospace problems showcasing analytical and numerical modeling techniques. Each problem includes detailed documentation (PDF) and MATLAB implementations.

### File-2:
Two satellite system case studies were modeled using both causal and acausal approaches. Includes problem descriptions (PDF) and corresponding MATLAB, Simulink, and OpenModelica models for simulation and analysis.
